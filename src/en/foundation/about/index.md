## Supporting the Future of Storage

**The Ceph Foundation supports the Ceph project and community**

The Ceph Foundation is made up key commercial, government, and
educational stakeholders who pool financial resources and collaborate
in investment, development, marketing, and community events for the
Ceph open source project.  The Ceph Foundation is organized under the
Linux Foundation and serves both as a resource for the Ceph community
as a point of coordination and collaboration among key industry and
community members.

Ceph stays true to its open source philosophy and roots by leaving
technical development in the hands of the developer community.  The
technical direction of Ceph is handled by the [Ceph Leadership
Team](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/governance/#ceph-leadership-team)
(CLT).

### Ceph Foundation Membership

Membership in the Ceph Foundation is tiered: Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond,
and Associate.  There are many benefits to belonging to The Ceph Foundation,

[See the benefits](../member-benefits/)

Silver to Diamond Member organizations contribute a yearly fee, whereas
Associate Members are educational institutions, government, or non-profit
organizations invited to join at no cost.

Diamond and Platinum Members are guaranteed a seat on the Governing Board. Two
Gold Members are chosen to represent all Gold Members, one Silver Member is
chosen to represent the Silver Members, and similarly one Associate Member is
chosen to represent all Associate Members on the board.

### The Ceph Foundation Board

The Governing Board consists of Foundation members who
organize and distribute financial contributions for the improvement of
the Ceph project, oversee community activities and developments, and
work together to fulfil a variety of responsibilities. Foundations are a
proven method to effectively collaborate and pool resources on large
projects to encourage participation, spread responsibility and
increase investment.

The Ceph Foundation Board is responsible for:

- Building and approving an annual budget for spending in support of the Ceph project.
- Establishing ad-hoc committees to address current needs of the project.
- Coordinating combined marketing activities surrounding the Ceph.
- Meeting regularly to discuss Foundation activities, the status of the Ceph project, and overall project strategy.
- Voting on any decisions or matters before the board.

The Ceph Foundation is organized under the umbrella of the Linux
Foundation, who provides financial, logistical, and other support
services.

## Frequently asked questions

<details open>
  <summary>Q: Why did the community decide to start a foundation? Why is a foundation needed?</summary>

While Ceph is supported by an incredibly vibrant community of
contributors, users and global companies around the world, the Ceph
Foundation will organize and distribute financial contributions in a
coordinated, vendor-neutral fashion. The foundation will also provide
a forum for community stakeholders to coordinate their development and
community activities on a regular basis. This will help galvanize more
rapid adoption, training and in-person collaboration across the Ceph
ecosystem.

As seen with countless other open source projects, providing a neutral
home for the community to collaborate will encourage more
participation and contribution. Foundations enable the community to
spread responsibilities and costs for project infrastructure–helping
to increase overall investment–while also providing more opportunities
to get involved.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: Why should developers care?</summary>

The foundation will provide more resources for Ceph development, which
will benefit all contributors and those consuming or looking to
consume Ceph. Some examples of support include organizing events and
working groups to accelerate the pace of growth for Ceph, coordinating
investments in additional hardware and cloud services infrastructure
for CI and testing, formalizing governance structures, and providing
marketing support to the project.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: How will this impact the technical direction of Ceph?</summary>

The technical communities of Linux Foundation projects are
independent, and Ceph will continue to develop according to its own
road maps and timetables with input from the newly established
Governing Board on project needs outside of the development
process. The Linux Foundation accelerates the development of open
source projects by providing the underlying assistance and governance
that is necessary for collaborative work, including infrastructure and
support for developers, events, marketing and community facilitation.

For more information, see the [Governance
page](http://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/governance/) in the Ceph
documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Q: What is the difference between Membership tiers?</summary>

The Membership benefits are detailed [here](../member-benefits/).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Q: How is the Ceph Foundation organized?</summary>

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux
Foundation. That means that the Foundation is not a separate legal
entity, and avoids the legal and managerial overhead associated with
forming a truly independent organization. Instead, we take advantage
of the Linux Foundation as an umbrella organization while keeping the
Ceph Foundation finances in an independent fund for use in supporting
the Ceph open source community.
